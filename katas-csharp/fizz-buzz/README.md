# Goal

Write a program that returns the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".

# New requirements

 - A number is Fizz if it has a 3 in it
 - A number is Buzz if it has a 5 in it
 - A number is FizzBuzz if
 	- it has a 3 in it
 	- it has a 5 in it

 - The previous requirements are still correct.
